**Title**: Switching to Python: Computation & Stat Basics for Matlab and NCL Converts

**Abstract**: 
If you are a beginner or Matlab/NCL user, the “Python-mania” is worth your attention. 
Yes, it may be intimidating maneuvering through a new, vast world of libraries and 
object-oriented computing. However, NumPy and Dask arrays are powerful for computation, 
Xarray and Pandas make manipulating large datasets with labels and attributes straightforward, 
and the figures produced are attractive and easy to control. During this Lunch Byte, 
we will be solving ODEs, creating PDF/KDEs, and performing linear regressions through 
the Jupyter live-coding notebook. Because there have been Lunch Byte introductions to 
Dask, Pandas and Xarray already, I will not spend time describing them; rather, 
I will be demonstrating more complex math and statistics you can do using these tools 
as well as others. You will also need to have Anaconda installed on your computer to 
code along with me (otherwise just follow along!).
