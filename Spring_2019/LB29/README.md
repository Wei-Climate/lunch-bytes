**Title**: Xarray: An Introduction to Python’s Labeled Array Package

**Abstract**: Xarray is a recently developed Python package 
that introduces dimension labels and attributes for Numpy arrays. 
The base data model for Xarary is NetCDF, which makes it ideal for 
processing multi-dimensional arrays commonly used by physical scientists. 
Labeled dimensions allow for more manageable structure than raw Numpy 
arrays and help keep the order of the dataset in line. Xarray is a great 
introduction package for Python beginners to gain confidence in handling 
and understanding the structure of large datasets.

I will be running Jupyter Lab with a Notebook I’ve developed for 
the Lunch Byte, thus Conda is required if you want to follow along. 
The talk will also have some helpful code bits involving downloading data, 
functions, plotting, and speeding up for loops in Python that could be 
of use to others, particularly beginners and other graduate students.

**When**: Friday, April 19, 12 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
