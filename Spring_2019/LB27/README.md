**Title**: Neural Networks and TensorFlow: A Gentle Introduction

**Abstract**: This seminar will provide an introduction to the basics 
of both TensorFlow and neural networks in general. Much of the mathematics 
of neural networks will be avoided, as the focus is on helping interested 
students and researchers determine if deep learning is a good fit for their 
current or future work rather than the nuts and bolts of deep learning. 
Some questions I hope to answer are: Whatâ€™s behind all the hype around 
deep learning? What does my output mean? What types of network fit what 
type of problem? The other focus of this seminar is the TensorFlow library 
for deep learning (among other things). I hope to answer questions about 
TensorFlow such as: What are the benefits? How can I visualize my network 
performance? Can TensorFlow speed up my development time? 

**When**: Friday, April 5, 12 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
