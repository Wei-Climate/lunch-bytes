**Title**: Parallel Computing in Python with Dask on Pegasus

**Abstract**: You’ve built THE program that will change how we study 
volcanic prediction in the northern tip of Isabela Island. There’s 
only one problem: it takes 10 hours to run one dataset... and you have 
750 datasets to analyze. So you just parallelize the algorithm. Easy, right? 

In this talk, we will explore the Dask parallelization framework with 
the goal of writing parallel algorithms on Pegasus. We will cover three 
main topics:

1. Basic parallelization with [Dask](https://dask.org);
2. How to configure [dask.distributed](http://distributed.dask.org/en/latest) on Pegasus;
3. Tricks and tips for speeding up your parallel algorithm.

Please have a version of Anaconda installed and take a look at 
[Tim Norris’s introduction to Dask](https://github.com/milancurcic/lunch-bytes/tree/master/Fall_2018/LB18). 

**When**: Friday, April 12, 12 pm.
