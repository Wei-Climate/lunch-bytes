Title: Introduction and Tutorial on NASA GISS Panoply and the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS)

Summary:
A large amount of Earth science data is in NetCDF format, and free tools such as NASA GISS Panoply and the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) allow easy access, manipulation, and visualization of your data.

Topics to include:

    * Use of the free tool NASA GISS Panoply to easily view and plot gridded NetCDF data, and perform very simple analysis of 2 arrays;
    * Introduction to the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) for accessing, manipulating, and visualizing earth science data with focus on NetCDF files;
    * Basic plotting of NetCDF data in GrADS and simple analysis techniques, outputting NetCDF files to combine GrADS and Panoply
