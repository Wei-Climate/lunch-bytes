**Title**: Gain control over your plots: Exploring the Matplotlib potential

**Abstract**: 
As scientists, our job is to convince other scientists, politicians, 
and the general public that we found something new based on a set of evidences.
The way we choose to present our results plays a crucial role in how people receive this information. 
In this talk I will discuss the importance of tailoring your plots to the 
specific message you want to transmit, 
and how we can achieve that by exploring some capabilities of the Matplotlib Python library.

**When**: Friday, November 7, 12 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
