**Title**: NASA's data services: Better and better

**Abstract**: 
I will remind you about NASA’s data services universe, and emphasize what’s new and upcoming. 

* Growing data volumes, evolving user interests and tools 
* The big three: Worldview, Giovanni, Earthdata Search. Plans for improvement, and better interplay. 
* NASA’s cloud plans: data lakes and data-adjacent computing 
* My impressions of data services professional life and that career path 

This material is drawn from last week’s meeting of the User Working Group for NASA’s biggest data center (called GES-DISC). 

**When**: Friday, October 4, 12 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
