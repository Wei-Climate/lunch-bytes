**Title**: Breaking up with Basemap: Upgrading to Cartopy for basic mapping in Python

**Abstract**: 
Python's classic mapping library, Matplotlib's Basemap, 
is being replaced by the Cartopy Project. 
The announcement of Basemap depreciation with newer versions of Python 
has left pressing anxiety to make the Cartopy switch as Python 2.7 
also nears end of life in 2020. 
For experienced Pythonites, upgrading small portions of reliable code 
can be daunting. 
For newer Pythonites, knowing where to start with mapping in Python 
can be intimidating. 
This Lunch Byte will outline the differences between both packages 
and provide example codes (via Jupyter Lab) for all Pythonites 
to get started with Cartopy.
