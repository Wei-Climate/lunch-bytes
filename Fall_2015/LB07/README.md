Title: Data Analysis and High Quality Graphics with NCL

NCL is an interpreted language specifically designed for scientific data 
analysis and visualization (emphasis on Earth science applications). It 
supports a large variety file formats, which are common in the 
scientific community, such as NetCDF 3/4, GRIB 1/2, HDF 4/5, shapefile, 
ascii, and binary. In this Lunch byte seminar, we will learn about NCL 
language basics, File I/O, and data processing. Moreover, I will show 
how NCL can be used to produce high quality graphics for journal 
articles, presentations, or web applications.
