Title: Handling large data sets using Climate Data Operators (CDO)

Speaker: Dian Putrasahan (RSMAS)

Summary:
One of the most dreaded error to get from Matlab is "OUT OF MEMORY". CDO steps in to fill that void, using very little memory to to process files that are larger than the physical memory. We will go through some examples and combine it with a simple shell-script to illustrate what a useful tool it can be for analysis. Some basics we will touch:
- file operations and information
- selection of particular variables, regions, layers, time, etc.
- arithmetic operators
- simple statistical analysis
- regression and interpolation
