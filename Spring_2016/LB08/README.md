**Speaker**: Eleanor Middlemas (RSMAS)

**Title**: STARSHIP MATLAB - It's not as scary as you think

**Where and when**: MSC 329, 12-1pm, Wednesday, February 17, 2016

**Summary**:

All disciplines of science can benefit from using MATLAB. Brian Mapes calls it “STARSHIP MATLAB” because of its enormous spread of functionality. This talk will encourage non-users that MATLAB is indeed useful and give current users a chance to trade ideas about how they use it.  

The format of the talk will be primarily open discussion. Current users are encouraged to open the floor with their questions and opinions about the following:

1. Becoming familiar with MATLAB interface
  * Opening code
  * Code layout
  * Running code
  * Understanding the “workspace”

2. Understanding the language through simple math

3. Loading data, plotting 

4. Becoming familiar with help online

5. Statistical analysis

6. If time is left:
  * Array manipulation and for-loops
  * Writing your own functions
