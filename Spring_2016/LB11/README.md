**Title**: Word Processors? Ainâ€™t Nobody Got Time For That: An Introduction to LaTeX

**Where and when**: MSC 329, 12-1pm,  Wednesday, March 30, 2016

**Summary**:

LaTeX is a free document preparation system for high-quality typesetting that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. This includes typesetting templates for many journals and universities, clean display of mathematical formulas, and the automatic generation of the bibliography and table of contents. What does all this mean? You, the writer, spend less time on document design/format and more time on content! Now that the University of Miami has released a LaTeX template for the Graduate dissertation, it's the perfect time to become familiar with the system. This presentation will focus on i) a general breakdown of LaTeX code, ii) generating bibliographies, iii) examples of basic equations, figures, and tables, iv) taking a look at the UM LaTeX Template.
