**Summary**:

How to go about designing a website on your own? With website-building services like Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, things have become very simple. Create an account, choose a template, fill in content, and publish the page. But, If following templates is not your thing, if you want the page to be all yours, if you want to customize it exactly the way you want to, if you want to understand what your browser is doing, or if you just want to learn something new (or re-learn something you once knew), an introduction to building websites with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap might be exactly what you need. Come learn about how to create a basic website using HTML, how to make it look exactly the way you want using CSS, and how to start reaching people on multiple platforms by using Bootstrap. Whether you’re creating a personal or business website, or simply a page where you dump your research data so it’s all in one place, knowing the basics of how the web world works is something you’ll surely find useful.
