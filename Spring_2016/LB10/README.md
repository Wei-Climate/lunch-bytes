**Speaker**: Josh Noe (Mixed in Key Inc.)

**Title**: From whaaa?? to ohhhh: Writing maintainable code.

**Where and when**: MSC 329, 12-1pm,  Wednesday, March 16, 2016

**Summary**:

Think that tail recursion is it's own reward? 
Write bullet-proof xml parsers in assembly? 
Congrats, you're an amazing programmer!

But can anyone tell what the hell your code is doing? 
Can you even tell what it's doing? 
Do bug reports give you involuntary spasms knowing you'll have to dig into that 
awful smelly heap of heap allocators you made?

Spasm no more. Let's write code that's built to last. We'll cover:

  * Single Responsibility Principal
  * Name things!
  * Use conventions
  * Don't show off
  * Stay DRY, but not parched
  * Comments
  * Common pitfalls of doom
  * Dependency Injection / Inversion of control
  * Cleaning up someone else's mess
  * Code reviews
  * And more!

I encourage everyone to "bring in" (or make available on Github) their code. 
If there's time at the end, we can all review it together.
