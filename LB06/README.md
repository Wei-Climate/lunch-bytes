Title: Machine learning methods for satellite image processing: Neural 
Networks and Support Vector Machines

Summary:
* The Problem of Pattern Recognition
* The Machine Learning Approach
* What are Neural Networks?
  * Background
  * Training a feedforward neural network by backpropagation
  * Application: Using a neural network to classify algal blooms in a satellite image
* What are Support Vector Machines?
  * Background and easy explanation of what they are and what they can do. Some math illustrated for the masochists.
  * Use SVMs on a satellite image using a one-class learning method and achieve a binary classification image to detect algal blooms.
  * Toolboxes and Modules for Machine Learning
