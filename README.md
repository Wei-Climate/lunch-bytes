## Presenter Guidelines

* The seminar should be 45 minutes or shorter.
* Decide between show and tell vs. live code with teaching. The latter will consume a lot of time so make sure you account for that.
* Welcome to ask @milancurcic or @raybellwaves for feedback before and/or after the seminar.
* Any format welcome! Slides, live-code, whiteboard, or just your voice.

## Contributing

Please create a folder for your seminar as LBXX and upload any contents (e.g. slides (pdf's can be read on GitHub), codes, environmental files as well as a README file).
